The scenario source of "TINY-MYSTERY HOUSE" has been released to the following.
Please look it.

    <a href="open.htm">open.txt</a>

Download the text adventure game creation tool from the following.

  Unpacked the directory is divided for Windows, macOS, Linux, Raspberry Pi.

1. Write a scenario in text format.

   Windows user: Please write with character code "SJIS".
   Other users : Please write with the character code "UTF-8".

2. Encrypt the text file with the scenario conversion program "enc_scn.hs".

   Run from the console as follows:

   cutehspcl enc_scn.hs

<img src="enc_scn.png">

   Since the file name is asked, if the text file is "open.txt", press "open" and press Enter.
   Then an encrypted scenario file called "open.scn" is generated.

3. Execute "cutehspcl".

   When "cutehspcl" is executed, it reads "start.hs" automatically and executes it.
   And "start.hs" is executed, it first reads "open.scn".
